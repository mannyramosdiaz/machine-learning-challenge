# machine-learning-challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models

The machine learning model verifies the precision and accuracy of the findings using the raw data and assigning each observation a title and it's verocity in it's exoplanet description.
